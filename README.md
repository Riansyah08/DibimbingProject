🎓 Student Scores Prediction – Dibimbing.ID Data Series 14.0
This repository contains my project submission for the Dibimbing.ID Data Series 14.0 program. The task focuses on applying Machine Learning in AI to predict student scores based on study hours — a classic regression problem.

The entire process, from data exploration to model deployment using Google Cloud, is documented in a Jupyter Notebook.

📁 Project Overview
📊 Problem: Predict student scores from their study hours.

🤖 Solution: Build and train a simple regression model.

☁️ Platform: Leveraged Google Cloud for scalable and efficient model training.

🛠️ Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Google Colab

📌 How to Use
Download the dataset
Grab the dataset student_scores.csv and place it in the same directory as the notebook.

Open the Notebook
Launch student_score_regression.ipynb in Jupyter or Google Colab.

Run All Cells
The notebook is fully documented and ready to run. Follow each section to understand the ML process.

🔍 Highlights
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

📈 Data Visualization

🧠 Linear Regression Model Training

📊 Evaluation using MSE, RMSE, and R²

☁️ Integrated with Google Cloud for model experimentation
