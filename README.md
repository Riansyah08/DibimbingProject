# **🎓 Student Scores Prediction – Dibimbing.ID Data Series 14.0**
This repository contains my project submission for the **Dibimbing.ID Data Series 14.0** program.  
The task focuses on applying **Machine Learning in AI** to **predict student scores based on study hours** — a classic regression problem. The entire process, from data exploration to model deployment using **Google Cloud**, is documented in a **Jupyter Notebook**.
<br>

### **📁 Project Overview**
**📊 Problem:** Predict student scores from their study hours.  
**🤖 Solution:** Build and train a simple regression model.  
**☁️ Platform:** Leveraged **Google Cloud** for scalable and efficient model training.  
**🛠️ Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Google Colab, Seaborn

### **📌 How to Use**
**1. Download the dataset**  
  Grab the dataset student_scores.csv and place it in the same directory as the notebook.  
**2. Open the Notebook**  
  Launch AIML_Assignment.ipynb in Jupyter or Google Colab.  
**3. Run All Cells**  
  The notebook is fully documented and ready to run. Follow each section to understand the ML process.
